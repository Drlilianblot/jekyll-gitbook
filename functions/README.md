# Functions

In <mark style="color:blue;background-color:red;">\\</mark><mark style="color:blue;background-color:red;"><mark style="color:red;">prettyref{cha:statements}<mark style="color:red;"></mark> we have seen some of the fundamental programming techniques to write simple program. This chapter introduces Python functions to perform common operations. First, we will study the **built-in** functions provided with the Python language. Secondly, we will be looking at common mathematical operations provided by the `math` module. Finally, we will learn how to create our own custom functions.
