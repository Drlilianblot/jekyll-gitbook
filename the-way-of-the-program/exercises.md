# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Python Documentation

Use a web browser to go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org). This page contains information about Python and links to Python-related pages, and it gives you the ability to search the Python documentation. For example, if you enter `print` in the search window, the first link that appears is the documentation of the `print` statement. At this point, not all of it will make sense to you, but it is good to know where it is.

## Exercise 2: The help functionality

Start the Python interpreter and type `help()` to start the online help utility. Or you can type `help('print')` to get information about the `print` statement. If this example doesn't work, you may need to install additional Python documentation or set an environment variable; the details depend on your operating system and version of Python.

## Exercise 3: A simple calculator

Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. Python's syntax for math operations is almost the same as standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols `+`, `-` and `/` denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is `*`. If you run a 10 kilometres race in 43 minutes and 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometres in a mile).
