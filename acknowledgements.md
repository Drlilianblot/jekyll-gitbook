# Acknowledgements

In the dynamic world of digital publishing, creating an eBook is a continuous journey of evolution and refreshment. It involves not only the initial creation but also ongoing updates and improvements to keep the content relevant and accurate. In this ever-changing landscape, numerous individuals have played a crucial role in helping me correct errors and typos, ensuring that this eBook remains a reliable and valuable resource for readers.

This acknowledgment section is dedicated to expressing my heartfelt gratitude to those who have committed their time and expertise to meticulously review and rectify these imperfections, contributing to the ongoing enhancement of this eBook.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Allen B. Downey, whose work served as an inspiration for my own book. Allen not only created a remarkable book for people wanting to learn programming and thinking like a computer scientist but also generously made his book first edition publicly available, providing invaluable guidance and motivation for me to embark on my writing journey. I am profoundly appreciative of Allen's role in kickstarting my own writing project, and I look forward to paying this inspiration forward by sharing my own work with others.

I would like to thank my colleague Dr Steven Wright who introduced me to GitBook universe. Following our informal chat, and inspired by his own published material, I was convinced to write my eBook using this format, not only facilitating the initial composition but also the ongoing implementation of updates and enhancements, in order to preserve the content's relevance and accuracy.

Finally, I would like to thanks the following students from the University of York (UK) who highlighted errors and typos throughout the text.
