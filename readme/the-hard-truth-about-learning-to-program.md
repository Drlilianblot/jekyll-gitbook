# The Hard truth about learning to program

You probably have seen videos on YouTube stating that you can learn programming in a day or even a few hours. Let me be clear, this is false advertising. In a similar way, I could tell you that you will paint like an artist by showing you a video on how to paint by numbers. I have tried and I can assure you I am no Leonardo Da Vinci. Introductory programming courses are known to be particularly challenging, with a third of the students in the US either  failing the course or dropping out. Having said that, learning basic elements of programming in a month is certainly possible, but it depends on the amount of time and effort you are willing to invest and the complexity of the programming concepts and languages you want to learn. You need to be committed to learning and have a structured learning plan in place. Consistent practice, challenging yourself with coding exercises and projects, and seeking feedback from others can help you accelerate your progress and solidify your understanding of programming concepts.&#x20;

One of the strongest indicators of success in programming courses in Higher Education is keeping up with the weekly work, especially at the start of a module. So in a few words, Try not to fall behind. If you are completely new to programming, it may take several weeks or even months to get comfortable with basic programming concepts, such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions, among others. It's essential to understand these fundamental concepts before moving on to more advanced topics and applying them to real-world problems. It's important to keep in mind that programming is a vast and complex field, and becoming a proficient programmer takes years. However, with dedication and persistence, you can develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become a successful programmer.
