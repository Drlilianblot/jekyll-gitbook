<summary>Exercise 1:</summary>

Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
width = 17 
height = 12.0 
delimiter = '.' 
```
{% endcode %}

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value returned by the expression).

* `width/2`
* `width/2.0`
* `height/3`
* `1 + 2 * 5`
* `delimiter * 5`

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.&#x20;
