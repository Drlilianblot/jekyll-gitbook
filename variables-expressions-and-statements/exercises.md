# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
width = 17 
height = 12.0 
delimiter = '.' 
```
{% endcode %}

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value returned by the expression).

* `width/2`
* `width/2.0`
* `height/3`
* `1 + 2 * 5`
* `delimiter * 5`

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

## Exercise 2

Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

* The volume of a sphere with radius $$r$$ is $$\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?\
  **Hint:** 392.6 is incorrect!
* Suppose the cover price of a book is £24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs £3 for the first copy and 75 pence for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
* If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8'15" per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7'12" per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
