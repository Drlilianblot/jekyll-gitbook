# The for statement

The syntax of a `for` statement is similar to a function definition. It has a header that ends with a colon and an indented body. The body can contain any number of statements. A `for` statement is sometimes called a **loop** because the flow of execution runs through the body and then loops back to the top. In this case, it runs the body of the loop a thousand times.
