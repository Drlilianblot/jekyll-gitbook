# Exercises

## Exercise 1: printing a grid (revisited)

This [exercise ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] can be done using only the statements and other features we have learned so far.

1. Write a function `twoByTwoGrid` that draws a grid like the following:

```
+ - + - +
|   |   |
+ - + - +
|   |   |
+ - + - +
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This time, you should use iteration
{% endhint %}

```bash
>>> print('line 1 \nline 2')
 line 1 
 line 2 
>>> print('line 1' + '\n' + 'line 2')
 line 1 
 line 2
>>> 
```

A `print` statement all by itself ends the current line and goes to the next line.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
def twoByTwoGrid():
    print('+', '-', '+', '-', '+')
    print('|', ' ', '|', ' ', '|')
    print('+', '-', '+', '-', '+')
    print('|', ' ', '|', ' ', '|')
    print('+', '-', '+', '-', '+')


```
{% endcode %}

Note: this is not a very good solution, a better approach is used in the solution for the function `fourByFourGrid.`

2. Write another function `fourByFourGrid` to draw a similar grid with four rows and four columns.

<summary>Model answer</summary>

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
def fourByFourGrid ():
    oddLine = '+ - ' * 4 + '+\n'
    evenLine = '|   ' * 4 + '|\n'
    grid = (oddLine + evenLine) * 4 + oddLine
    print(grid)
```
{% endcode %}

Note: This solution is better than the one given for the function `twoByTwoGrid`. It is important to familiarise ourselves with manipulating string to build the expected output.&#x20;

3. Write a more generic function `xbyYGrid(rows, cols)` that draws a similar grid with `rows` rows and `cols` columns.&#x20;

## Exercise 2: Newton's method

After reading the section on [Newton's method](newtons-method.md#newtons-method-for-computing-square-root) to compute the square root of a number, write a function called `squareRoot` that takes `a` as a parameter, chooses a reasonable value of `x`, and returns an estimate of the square root of `a`.

## Exercise 3:

To test the square root algorithm implemented in exercise 2, you could compare it with `math.sqrt`. Write a script that prints a table like this:

```
1.0   1.0             1.0             0.0 
2.0   1.41421356237   1.41421356237   2.22044604925e-16 
3.0   1.73205080757   1.73205080757   0.0 
4.0   2.0             2.0             0.0 
5.0   2.2360679775    2.2360679775    0.0 
6.0   2.44948974278   2.44948974278   0.0 
7.0   2.64575131106   2.64575131106   0.0 
8.0   2.82842712475   2.82842712475   4.4408920985e-16
9.0   3.0             3.0             0.0
```

The first column is a number, $$a$$; the second column is the square root $$\sqrt{a}$$ computed with the algorithm from exercise 2; the third column is the square root computed by `math.sqrt`; the fourth column is the absolute value of the difference between the two estimates.

## Exercise 4: Srinivasa Ramanujan infinite series

The brilliant mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an [infinite series](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) that can be used to generate a numerical approximation of $$\pi$$:

$$
\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}
$$

Write a function `estimatePI()` that uses this formula to compute and return an estimate of $$\pi$$. It should use a `while` loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is smaller than `1e-15` (which is Python notation for $$10^{-15}$$). You can check the result by comparing it to `math.pi`.
