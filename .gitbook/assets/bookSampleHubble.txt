PHOTOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS OF FAINT NEBULAE
BY EDWIN P. HUBBLE

The study of nebulae is essentially a photographic problem for cameras
of wide angle and reflectors of large focal ratio. The photographic
plate presents a definite and permanent record beside which visual
observations lose most of their significance. Perhaps the one field
left for the older method is the measurement of sharp nuclei deeply
enshrouded in nebulosity. New nebulae are now but rarely seen in the
sky, although an hourâ€™s exposure made at random with a large reflector
has more than an even chance of adding several small faint objects to
the rapidly growing list of those already known. About 17,000 have
already been catalogued, and the estimates of those within reach of
existing instruments, based on the ratio of those previously known to
those new in various fields, lie around 150,000.
